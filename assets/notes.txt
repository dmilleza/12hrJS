* What is Javascript?
- Javascript is one of the core technologies of the web, alongisde HTML & CSS.
- It is a high-level, interpreted programming language that can be used on the 
client side as well as the server-side with Node.js.
- Interpreted means executed line by line rather than being compiled into machine 
code first. So the code is executed on the fly making it a scripting language.

* What is Javascript used for?
- Used to manipulate the DOM, which is a tree-like structure of nodes and everything
on the page is a node including every HTML tag, every attribute, every piece of
text and so on. 
- Javascript provides methods for dynamically changing the content or the styles 
of the elements in the DOM.
- It allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages that can respond
to user actions. Those user actions are called events, so we can respond to mouse
clicks, or drags, or hovers, keyboard events, form submissions, and just about
anything you can think of that you can do in the browser. 
- Making asynchronous requests is one of the most powerful uses of JS, and it's 
used to interact with back-end servers whether it's your own server or a public
API. We can make HTTP requests right from our code to fetch data or submit data,
and this happens all behind the scenes without having to refresh the page. These
are often used in what are called single page applications (SPAs) to dynamically
load and update content without having to reload the entire page. 
- Animations and effects can be created by using CSS transitions and animations,
request animation frame method, and different libraries.
- Data manipulation is the process of modifying or transforming data, and JS is a
full-featured language with data structures like arrays. 
- Data can be stored on the client or in the browser using things like local 
storage, session storage, and cookies. 
- SPAs are applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update the 
content without having to reload the entire page, this provides a seamless and 
responsive user experience. You'd usually use a front-end framework for building
SPAs like React, View, or Angular. 
- JS can also be used on the server side with the Node.js runtime as well as Dino,
so in addition to consuming APIs from the front end, we can also create APIs that 
interact with databases on the back end. 

* Why Learn Javascript?
- Popularity: one of the most widely used languages. Many job opportunities.
- Versatility: used for many different things, such as web pages, APIs, and 
mobile/desktop applications.
- Easy to learn: compared to other lower level languages, great to start with.

* Environment Setup
- For vanilla front end JS, all you need is a text editor and a browser.
- VS Code is the most popular text editor for web development. 
- Git is a version control system where we can create repositories with our code
and push to third-party services like Github or Gitlab. 
- Recommended extensions:
    1. Live server gives you a mini dev server that you can run your files with, 
    and it will reload in the browser whenever you make any changes. 
    2. Prettier keeps your code nice and clean. Can automatically save or delete
    semicolons.

- When opening with live server, you can see "127.0.0.1" in the URL bar which is 
our local host. It's called our loopback address and it runs on port 5500 by 
default.

- Every browser has developer tools. The "elements" tab is for HTML and CSS. The 
console is where we'll see all of our front-end JS warnings and errors.
